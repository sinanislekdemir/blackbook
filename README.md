Project BlackBook
===================


About the project
----------
BlackBook is a pure Ruby 3D Library that aims developers to write their 3D applications with ease of Ruby. Please keep in mind that, this project is still a **work in progress** and is **not suitable to use** I suppose. But try it for yourself. Feel free to fix it, improve it and be a contributor for the project.


Documents
-------------

For documentation, I am trying to write as many comments as possible and keep the code clean and meaningful with giving proper variable names and keeping a standard. 
Some parts of the code is messy, as I mentioned, I did not refactor it yet.
Documentations are generated with **yardoc** and code standards can be checked with **rubocop**. I needed to flex the standards a bit. ;)

I hope you enjoy it. You can find the requirements inside Gemfile.
After all, just give it a shot!
